# face_recognition_basic_implementation
Inside the image folder remove the pic that I've uploaded.
Then create new folder that will contain image of a specific person in each folder. 
It's a good practice if you upload 5-10 picture of each people. And it will be more helpful if you crop the image to only the face.
To avoid detection error try not to upload photo that contains multiple faces in one image.
Run the Faces_train.py first then run the face.py
